## Need to know

> - Run `composer install` before launch for the first time this project.  
> If you get error, execute this command : `composer install --ignore-platform-reqs` (man hack I know)

> - You can run project through command `composer serve` which will start it on http://127.0.0.1:8080/ by default. You can change it in composer.json

> - You can change MYSQL configuration in config/autoload.php. Then you will have to make `composer dump-autoload`. Then, for be sure of applied modifications,
